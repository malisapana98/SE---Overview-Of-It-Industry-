          1) =:> Software engineers create web applications, mobile apps, robots, operating systems, and network systems. 

          They develop software solutions that meet their companies' needs and expectations. Note that the terms "software engineer" and "

          software developer" are used interchangeably in the industry, but these positions' responsibilities vary slightly.




        2) What Does a Software Engineer Do?


         *  Computer software engineers develop programs and operating systems for computers. They work with system programmers, analysts, and other 

                    engineers to design systems, project capabilities, and determine performance interfaces.

        *  Computer software engineers also analyze user needs, provide consultation services to discuss design elements, and coordinate software 

                    installation.Designing software systems requires engineers to consider mathematical models and scientific analysis to project outcomes.






      3) Main Duties of Software Engineers


       * System Design:->  System design involves defining the outline for web applications and products efficiently and clearly. These designs provide 

         information and data in the coding framework for the software developer to make the product.


       *  Establish New Documentation:-> All new technology requires documentation for people to understand its functionality. This might look like creating 

          or updating products and supporting documentation. The software engineer writes this supporting documentation.




       *  Maintain Software Functionality:-> Software engineers maintain existing software and create new software. This includes making 

          updates to align with the 

          latest industry and company standards, troubleshooting problems, and brainstorming future improvements. Maintenance is equally as important as 

          writing new code.
